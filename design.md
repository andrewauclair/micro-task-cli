app is usable as an interactive cli just like the current micro-task. The app is also available as a service to other apps (run it with a port connection). Another option is running it with command line arguments and it spits back a response.

Basic commands:

add (tasks, lists, groups, projects, milestones)

start

stop

finish

search

schedule

rename

project

group

list

exit

alias
